These are add-ons I consider using.

I don't have the time to properly maintain them.

I usually break add-ons while I try to change them.

If I am not interested in any add-on anymore I will delete it without notice.

I suggest that you fork this repository if you are interested in any add-on

This button is mostly for my own convenience:
